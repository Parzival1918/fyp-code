# bash

Bash scripts that I used during the final year project in the Stanage HPC.

- `cancel_function.sh`: Function to list the jobs both running and in the queue and then cancel one of them.
- `newrun_function.sh`: Function to create a new run by copying the files in a `template/` folder and taking the using the `prod_data.lmp` file of the previous run as the `data.lmp` file of the new run.
- `queue_function.sh`: Function and aliases to view the currently running jobs and the ones in the queue.
